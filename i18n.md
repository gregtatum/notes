### ECMA 402 - The ECMAScript Internationalization API
  - Intl.Collator
  - Intl.DateTimeFormat.prototype

### Unicode

### Unicode CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository)
 - Website: http://cldr.unicode.org/
 - Github: https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr
   - Annotations: https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/master/common/annotations/en.xml
   - Common info: https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/master/common/main/en.xml

 - Plural rules spec: http://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules
 - Includes many types of translation information, e.g.
    * Translations for language names.
    * Translations for territory and country names.
    * Translations for currency names, including singular/plural modifications.
    * Translations for weekday, month, era, period of day, in full and abbreviated forms.
    * Translations for time zones and example cities (or similar) for time zones.
    * Translations for calendar fields.
    * Patterns for formatting/parsing dates or times of day.
    * Exemplar sets of characters used for writing the language.
    * Patterns for formatting/parsing numbers.
    * Rules for language-adapted collation.
    * Rules for formatting numbers in traditional numeral systems (like Roman numerals, Armenian numerals, â€¦).
    * Rules for spelling out numbers as words.
    * Rules for transliteration between scripts. Much of it is based on BGN/PCGN romanization.
 - LDML - Locale Data Markup Language
  * http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/
  * An XML format for the communication of locale data

### Things to research

### Terms
 - Collation - Sort order for characters of different languages.
 - Exemplar Characters - the commonly used letter s for a given modern form of a language
 - Segmentation - Splitting on characters
 - Normalization - Normalizing inputs that match visually indistinguishable glyphs that have a different, but canonically equivalent, code point representation
